This project is from the car alart system when some of the door or the trunk(boot) is not closed or locked and also the state of the safety belt. 
It combines the use of buttons and LEDs. The buttons are used to emulate the lock sensor while the LEDs give visual warning to the driver as shown in the image below. .
The two yellow buttons are for the door and the trunk while the red button is used to emulate the belt lock sensor.
When the trunk or the door is open, the red LED will light up and if they are both locked, a green light is displayed.
The red button, when in the on position, simulating the closed safety belt condition, causes the green light to be displayed. When in the off position, the Red LED light comes on.
